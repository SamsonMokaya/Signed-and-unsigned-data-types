Write pseudo code that will count all the odd numbers up 
to a user defined stopping point then it computes the average.


SET counter to 1
SET odd_sum to 0
SET odd_counter to 0
Declare OddAverate
Define stoping_point
FOR counter = 1 to stoping_point
	IF counter mod 2 != 0
		THEN
			PRINT 
				odd_sum
			INCREMENT odd_counter by 1
ENDFOR
COMPUTE 
	OddAverate = odd_sum / odd_counter
PRINT
	odd_counter
PRINT
	oddAverage
